Among other groups and individuals, she teaches Pilates and yoga to the staff of Children's Hospital (LA) and specializes in neuromuscular re-education and rehabilitation. In addition to the training Dr. Monroe received at Samra, she has completed several post-graduate training programs, including programs for the treatment of acute and chronic pain such as The Balance Method by Dr. Richard Tan, which utilizes points away from the injured area to help reduce inflammation and encourage muscle relaxation via distal reflex connections. She completed a one-year advanced Acupuncture Orthopedics course with Don Lee, L.Ac, making her AOA Board Certified in Acupuncture Orthopedics. She has also studied advanced herbal prescription construction and has completed several training programs in the treatment of women’s health issues, including fertility and reproductive health.\r\n\r\nDr. Monroe was also active in promoting her profession by serving on the American Association of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine’s Student Organization Council as a Regional Director as well as Co-Chair of the Media and Publication Committee. In serving so, she has written several articles for the Association’s professional online journal. Dr. Monroe earned a Ph.D in Oriental Medicine in June 2009. Her dissertation explored “The Treatment of Female Infertility due to Disorders of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Ovarian Axis,” which is one of her specialties along with treatment of pain syndromes, neuromuscular re-education and rehabilitation, pediatrics, and stress-related illness, such as digestive problems, depression, anxiety and insomnia. Dr. Monroe’s diverse educational background ensures that every patient receives the highly individualized treatment that is necessary for optimal health and she firmly believes that empowerment and education of the patient towards prevention and self-care is of the foremost importance in the healing process.","why_love":"","name":"Eastside Family Acupuncture","description":"Melissa M Monroe, Ph.D, L.Ac is the owner and founder of Eastside Family Acupuncture and is licensed by the State of California, as well as being nationally certified by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. \r\n\r\nAfter several unsuccessful operations on a knee injury, Dr. Monroe found amazing rehabilitative results from yoga, Pilates and acupuncture and began to study all of the modalities intensively.
